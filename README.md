# Machine learning project || By Itamar Kratiman || 2021

### Description
Hello! this is a machine learning project, were I handeled with two machine learning problems, with data sets from kaggle. 
Firstly, I investigated the data set from kaggle of [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) in order to make a binary classification. Starting with cleaning the data, then yeiling some conclusions from the data set using visuallization, and then applyied some machine learning agorithms such as KNN and LogisticRegression. 
Secondly, I investigated the data set from kaggle of [Used car price](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swatikhedekar/car-price-prediction) in order to make a regression and try to predict the price of the cars. Strating with visuallization in order to yeild some conclusions about the data, and then applyied some regression algortihms such as Linear regression and KNN regressor.
